 \label{chap:intro}
 In the era of Google glass, people want everything in front of them to be explicable. Just like in the domain of sports, one would like to obtain the highlights of a match in terms of statistics, such as duration of ball control by respective team in footbal. Similarly in the sphere of surveillance, detecting multiple simultaneous events can be helpful. Also annotating events helps in an effective video retrieval system to associate high level information in video along with the textual description.
\par In our problem definition, we are given internet  videos labeled with an event class, where the label specifies the events that occurs within video. In most of the dataset these are weakly labeled settings, i.e we do not have spatio-temporal segmentation, indicating coordinates and time points where at  which event occurs.  The detection aspect of our problem manifests task of localizing the event within the video further building the spatio-temporal volume for better event prediction.
\par In section II, we we will discuss about the existing techniques used for event detection. We would also cover about our implementation of convolutional neural network in section III. In section IV, we will describe the steps for extracting spatio-temporal volume.
