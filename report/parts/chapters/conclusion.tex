 \section{Summary}
 We observe from the results, if the video segment is focused on the probable event region then performance of the model improves tremendously. We will continue to follow this approach along with additional thoughts mentioned in future works for the large scale and complex events detection and recognition in the next part of the project.
 \section{Future Work}
 We would  like to incorporate the segmentation information for determining the probable event regions in the video segment, this enable us to have much clearer boundaries to distinguish source of the event. We also like to revisit the indigenous convolutional neural network, to incorporate hierarchical learning, where we train the first layer of CNN and determine the classes that are quite similar based on CNN feature clustering, in subsequent layers we train the CNN to be able to discriminate the classes which were considered similar in previous layer. We would also like to explore ways for associating the objects and events that are present in the given video segment and build a knowledge base by annotating them in the video. It helps for more sophisticated video content retrieval allowing to step to the queried region within a video.
